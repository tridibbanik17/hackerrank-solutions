-- Technique   conditional-aggregation-pivot
-- Time        O(N log N)
-- Space       O(N)
-- Trick       The query uses ROW_NUMBER() to create grouping keys and MAX() with CASE statements to pivot categorical data into columns.
-- Hint        ROW_NUMBER() requires an ORDER BY clause within the OVER partition.

/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.
